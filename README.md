*** To run full Functionally ***
1. Copy the folders and files to a Netbeans Web Project
2. Configure the server
3. Create an MS Access database and change the paths in JSPs
Note: The MS Access is connected through JDBC-ODBC Bridge driver,
as this driver is being obsoleted in Java 8, so Java 7 is required to connect to MS Access database
or you can use Oracle database changing the driver and the driver-connection codes in JSPs.
